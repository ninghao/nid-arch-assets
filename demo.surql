The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists.

By teaching our body’s immune system to recognize and kill the drivers of cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths.\r\n\r\nA little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. \r\n\r\nOur team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in learning more about our approach to treat and prevent cancer, please reach out to us at contact@adventrispharma.com","id":"startup:g59b71i9moejxlqee7yl","industries":["Healthcare","Drug Discovery and Delivery"],"industry":"Healthcare","isHiring":false,"isTopRevenue":false,"isTopValuation":false,"launchedAt":1675190671,"location":"San Francisco, CA, USA; Baltimore, MD, USA; Remote","name":"Adventris Pharmaceuticals","oneline":"Adventris makes cancer vaccines","regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Partly Remote"],"slug":"adventris-pharmaceuticals","stage":"Early","status":"Active","tags":["Biotech","Healthcare","Therapeutics","Drug discovery","Oncology"],"teamSize":7,"updated":"2024-01-31T06:33:44.208547Z","website":"https://adventris.com"};

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor.

We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n \r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.\r\n\r\nBy coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.\r\n\r\nBy using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.\r\n\r\nYuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.\r\n\r\nFinally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.","id":"startup:m5ezlncq5f6l3s0hlfo2","industries":["B2B","Operations"],"industry":"B2B","isHiring":true,"isTopRevenue":false,"isTopValuation":false,"launchedAt":1677585502,"location":"Remote","name":"Yuma","oneline":"ChatGPT for customer support","regions":["Remote","Fully Remote"],"slug":"yuma","stage":"Early","status":"Active","tags":[],"teamSize":4,"updated":"2024-01-31T06:33:44.199621Z","website":"https://yuma.ai"};

In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale.

With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system.","id":"startup:v6443ic8cggiq94u87vk","industries":["Industrials","Climate"],"industry":"Industrials","isHiring":false,"isTopRevenue":false,"isTopValuation":false,"launchedAt":1688401921,"location":"London, England, United Kingdom","name":"Elyos Energy","oneline":"The platform for energy flexibility and demand response","regions":["United Kingdom","Europe"],"slug":"elyos-energy","stage":"Early","status":"Active","tags":["B2B","Climate","Energy","Renewable Energy","ClimateTech"],"teamSize":3,"updated":"2024-01-31T06:33:44.194445Z","website":"https://www.elyosenergy.com"};

The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. \r\n\r\nRazorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.\r\n\r\nRazorpay’s valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.\r\n\r\nThis commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: \r\n\r\nAcquired Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business’s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. \r\n\r\nCustomer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:\r\n\r\n- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:\r\n\r\n- First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ \r\n- Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI\r\n- Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. \r\n- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay. \r\n","id":"startup:wc1s42kjqn93wjzonsvx","industries":["Fintech","Payments"],"industry":"Fintech","isHiring":true,"isTopRevenue":false,"isTopValuation":true,"launchedAt":1416309883,"location":"Bengaluru, KA, India; Remote","name":"Razorpay","oneline":"India's leading financial platform for all things payments & banking…","regions":["India","South Asia","Remote","Partly Remote"],"slug":"razorpay","stage":"Growth","status":"Active","tags":["Payments","Finance","India"],"teamSize":2700,"updated":"2024-01-31T06:33:43.980336Z","website":"https://razorpay.com"};

We’re building an open core SaaS platform to streamline development and operation of data, ML, & LLM pipelines in a collaborative, self-service manner, utilizing a company's existing MLOps and data infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe believe self-service for Data Practitioners is the future because it enables domain modeling experts the velocity to iterate on pipelines & models without hand-off, which is key for businesses using ML/AI to differentiate themselves. Unless you’re a big tech company or someone like Stitch Fix that can afford a platform team, staffing teams with high ratios of engineers, or finding unicorn data scientists that can build pipelines is your only option; it not only slows time to value, it makes operating ML/AI expensive. \r\n\r\nWe’re here to change that. Think simple python that enables a low software engineering bar to describe what should happen, and then with some extra metadata, generates the workflow code, and that also consolidates several MLOps tools into a single platform, all in a self-service manner. It’s functional and usable by junior and senior folks alike.","id":"startup:zo0k5svey4exsdgv4eqa","industries":["B2B"],"industry":"B2B","isHiring":false,"isTopRevenue":false,"isTopValuation":false,"launchedAt":1672773099,"location":"Remote; San Francisco, CA, USA","name":"DAGWorks Inc.","oneline":"Unifying Platform Layer for Data, ML, & LLM Pipelines","regions":["United States of America","America / Canada","Remote","Fully Remote"],"slug":"dagworks-inc","stage":"Early","status":"Active","tags":["Developer Tools","Machine Learning","B2B","Open Source","Data Engineering"],"teamSize":2,"updated":"2024-01-31T06:33:44.217869Z","website":"https://www.dagworks.io/"};
